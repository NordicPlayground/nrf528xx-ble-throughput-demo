nRF528xx-ble-throughput-demo
=====================
Description
-----------
This example implements demonstrates the ble bandwidth with different settings including those available in ble 5.0. Settings are MTU packet size, connection interval, on air datarate and data length extension. It is based on the ble_app_att_mtu_throughput in the next SDK. The example can use the display shield or terminal to configure the settings and see the throughput achieved. A more in depth description can be found in this blogpost: https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/blogs/1078/.

Requirements
------------
- nRF5 SDK version [nRF5_SDK_13.0.0-1.alpha](http://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF5_SDK/nRF5_SDK_v13.x.x/nRF5_SDK_13.0.0-1.alpha_055eef3.zip)
- nRF52DK (PCA10040) or nRF52840 DK (PCA10056)

About this project
------------------
This application is one of several applications that has been built by the support team at Nordic Semiconductor, as a demo of some particular feature or use case. It has not necessarily been thoroughly tested, so there might be unknown issues. It is hence provided as-is, without any warranty. 

However, in the hope that it still may be useful also for others than the ones we initially wrote it for, we've chosen to distribute it here on GitHub. 

The application is built to be used with the official nRF5 SDK that can be downloaded from developer.nordicsemi.com
